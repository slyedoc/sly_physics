My physics system needs a lot more work, biggest issues where:
 - New Type pattern is kind of a pain 
 - Need a transform gizmo for editing
 - Handles, need to change colliders over asp,
 - Spent 2 days trying to make a physics based character controller and had to many issues, this lead to me not using the physics much
 - Really need to add mesh to convex collider back
 - Transform Hierarchy, I don't support it thats a huge problem
 - Need sensors
