# Bevy Physics Weekend

A Native Bevy physics plugin.

Most likely you should go use rapier, though I did wonder what a native bevy implementation would look like.

The aims to provide a simple bevy physics plugin that's completely native to bevy. The goal is to be faster than rapier, even if not a feature rich.

# Hi, I'm Slyedoc! ðŸ‘‹

I have [been](https://github.com/slyedoc) playing with bevy for a while now and the only real option you have for physics is [Rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier), either though [bevy_rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier) or [heron](https://github.com/jcornaz/heron).  While rapier is truly amazing, it's not made for bevy, it uses its own math lib [nalgebra](https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra) while bevy uses [glam](https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs).  Rapier also has to copy data in and out of ecs for its own internal representation.
